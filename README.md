# callbreak-card-game
Callbreak card game largely written in JS. (Almost complete).
Submitted it in a First year college project. Has remained untouched since.

# TODO
- Players all start with 3 calls each(its hardcoded). Build it such that it can be manually set. 
- Calculate the winner at the end.
